## Home_Sales
In Jupyter lab, I utilized SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. I calculated average prices for various types of homes and compared query speeds using cached versus uncached data and tables versus parquets. The AI Learning Assistant from the UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp provided coding support, including syntax checks. This project was completed in July 2024 as a requirement for the Data Analytics & Data Visualization Certificate from UC Berkeley Extension.
